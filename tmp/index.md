## What is Houston Mesh?

Houston Mesh is a community of Meshtastic users working together to create a highly resilient, city-wide mesh network. We focus on building a decentralized communication system that serves both as a hobby and a backup for when traditional networks fail.

## Why Join Us?
- Expand and strengthen the Houston Meshtastic network  
- Connect with other tech enthusiasts and radio hobbyists  
- Learn and share knowledge about mesh networking  
- Be prepared for emergency communication needs  
- Help new users get set up and running  

## How It Works

1. Meshtastic is an open-source, long-range, off-grid communication system.  
2. Devices use LoRa (Long Range) radio signals to relay messages across the network.  
3. The more users, the stronger and more reliable the network becomes.  

## Get Involved

1. **Get a Meshtastic Node** – Purchase or build your own device.  
2. **Connect & Configure** – We can help you set up your node.  
3. **Join the Network** – Start relaying and sending messages.  
4. **Help Expand the Mesh** – The more nodes, the better the coverage.
