## What is Houston Mesh?

Houston Mesh is a community of Meshtastic users working together to create a highly resilient, city-wide mesh network. We focus on building a decentralized communication system that serves both as a hobby and a backup for when traditional networks fail.

Our community is primarily active on Discord, where members discuss Meshtastic setups, share network updates, and help new users get started.
